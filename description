 Stock Market Prediction
Welcome to the Simple Stock Market Prediction project! This repository holds everything you need to predict stock market trends using computers. Our goal is to help you make informed decisions by creating computer programs that guess whether stock prices will go up or down.

What's Inside
Data Collection: We collect past stock prices and other helpful information, like news stories about the economy, to teach our computer how to make predictions.

Making Sense of Data: We organize the information in a way that computers can understand. This step is like putting together a puzzle so the computer can see patterns.

Guessing the Future: Our computers learn from the past to guess what might happen next. They try different methods to see which one is best at guessing.

Checking Accuracy: We see how well the computer guessed by comparing its predictions with what actually happened in the past. This helps us know if the computer is good at guessing.

Seeing the Results: We draw pictures to show the computer's guesses compared to what really happened. This helps us understand if the computer is doing a good job.

## If you want to help make the computer's guesses better, you can! If you find mistakes, tell us. If you have a better way of guessing, show us. We can work together to make the computer even smarter! ##
